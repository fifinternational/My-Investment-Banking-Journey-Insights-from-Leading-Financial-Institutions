# Task 3: Financial Analysis â€“ Run the Numbers for HappyHour Co.

## Task Description

In this task, you will prepare a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for HappyHour Co. based on the financial forecasts provided by the client, WorldWide Brewing Co. The head of M&A at WorldWide Brewing has appointed J.P. Morgan as their financial advisor for this transaction, and first-round bids are due next week. Your objective is to build a simple financial model that will help the client form a view on the valuation of HappyHour Co. and determine an appropriate bid price.

## Objectives

1. **Build a DCF Model**: You will need to populate a DCF model using the projections provided by the company. You have the option to start with either an advanced template, which requires more input and practice, or a basic template that has more formulas and instructions already populated. It is recommended to start with the advanced version to enhance your skills, but you can switch to the basic version if you encounter difficulties.

2. **Assumptions**: Utilize the following key assumptions for the DCF model:
   - Current share price: 165.0
   - Number of shares outstanding (NOSH): 199.0 million
   - Market capitalization: $328.4 million
   - Net debt: $84.6 million
   - Perpetuity growth rate: 0.5%
   - Perpetuity growth rate step-up: 0.25%
   - EBITDA multiple: 8.5x
   - EBITDA multiple step-up: 0.5x
   - Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): 8.5%
   - WACC step-up: 0.50%
   - Use NPV based on the perpetuity growth method.

3. **Summary Slide**: After completing the DCF model, create a summary slide that communicates your findings to the client. This slide should outline the key results of your valuation and the assumptions used in the model.

## Resources

To assist you in completing this task, you will have access to the following materials:
- **Company Forecasts**: Financial forecasts for HappyHour Co. for the years 2020 to 2025.
- **DCF Model Templates**: Two versions of past DCF models (basic and advanced) that you can leverage to build your own model.
- **Slide Template**: A PowerPoint slide template to present your summary findings.

## Conclusion

This task is crucial for providing WorldWide Brewing Co. with a clear understanding of HappyHour Co.'s valuation through a DCF analysis. Your work will help guide their decision-making process regarding the bid for the company. Ensure that your model is accurate and your summary slide effectively communicates the key insights derived from your analysis.

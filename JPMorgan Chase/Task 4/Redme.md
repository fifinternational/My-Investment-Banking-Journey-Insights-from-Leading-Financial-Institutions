# Task 4: Provide an Investment Recommendation for HappyHour Co.

## Task Description

In this task, you will revise your discounted cash flow (DCF) model for HappyHour Co. in light of unforeseen events that could impact the valuation. Specifically, you will address the financial implications of a recent fire at one of HappyHour Co.'s beer packaging plants and the competitive dynamics introduced by a rival company's bid for the same asset. Your revised investment recommendation will be communicated to WorldWide Brewing Co. as they prepare to submit a final, binding offer for HappyHour Co.

## Objectives

1. **Revise the DCF Model**: Update the DCF model based on the following new information:
   - The expected financial impact of the facility fire in FY21, which is projected to reduce revenue to $1,100 million (a decrease of approximately 4-5%).
   - Set the gross margin percentage to 50% for FY21 and calculate the gross profit accordingly.
   - Review the impact of these changes on the DCF output to determine the revised valuation of HappyHour Co.

2. **Write an Email to the Client**: Compose a brief email to the WorldWide Brewing Co. team addressing the following points:
   - Discuss key considerations regarding the impact of the fire, including potential offsetting factors and the materiality of the incident in the long term.
   - Evaluate the credibility of the report regarding the competitor's bid of over $650 million for HappyHour Co.
   - Present your revised valuation and compare it with the preliminary valuation to provide context for your recommendation.

## Resources

To assist you in completing this task, you will have access to the following materials:
- **Competitor Dynamics Article**: This article provides insights into the competitive landscape and the implications of rival bids.
- **DCF Model**: The DCF model prepared by your team earlier in the process, which you will need to revise based on the new information.

## Conclusion

This task is critical for providing WorldWide Brewing Co. with an updated investment recommendation that reflects the latest developments affecting HappyHour Co.'s valuation. Your analysis and communication will play a significant role in guiding their decision-making process as they finalize their bid for the company. Ensure that your revised DCF model is accurate and that your email effectively conveys the key insights and recommendations.

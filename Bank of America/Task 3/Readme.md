# Task 3: Financial Modeling

## Overview
In this task, you will create a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Nintendo as a potential acquisition target for Webflix. This exercise will help you understand how to project future cash flows, calculate the implied equity value and share price, and perform a sensitivity analysis to assess how changes in key assumptions affect the valuation.

## Objectives
- Learn how a DCF model is used to value an acquisition target.
- Calculate the implied equity value and share value of Nintendo using the DCF valuation method.
- Construct a sensitivity table showing how the valuation of Nintendo will change if key variables change.
- Summarize your findings in an email to your supervisors.

## Key Learning Points
- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation:** A method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows, adjusted for the time value of money.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** A technique used to determine how different values of an independent variable affect a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Download Resources
- Download the DCF Template and the Nintendo DCF Assumptions provided by Susan.

### 2. Enter Assumptions and Project Free Cash Flow
- Open the DCF template and enter the following assumptions:
  - Year 1 Revenue: $13.6 billion
  - YoY Revenue Growth: 5%
  - Year 1 EBITDA: $5.4 billion
  - Year 5 EBITDA Margin: 42%
  - Depreciation & Amortization as % Revenue: 0.7%
  - Year 1 Net Working Capital: 0
  - Net Working Capital as % of Revenue: 5%
  - Capital Expenditures as % Revenue: 0.5%
  - Cash: $9.2 billion
  - Debt: $50 million
  - Shares Outstanding: 1 billion
  - Tax Rate: 40%
  - WACC: 8.5%
  - Terminal Multiple: 12.0x

### 3. Calculate Enterprise Value and Equity Value
- Calculate the Present Value of Unlevered Free Cash Flow and the Present Value of the Terminal Value to determine the Implied Total Enterprise Value.
- Add Cash and subtract Debt from the Total Enterprise Value to calculate Total Equity Value.
- Divide the Total Equity Value by the number of shares outstanding to get the Implied Share Price Valuation.

### 4. Create a Sensitivity Table
- Construct a sensitivity analysis to show how the Companyâ€™s Enterprise Value and Implied Share Price change with variations in the Terminal Multiple and WACC.
- Highlight the mid-range of the table and bold the middle figure to indicate the midpoint valuation.

### 5. Share Your Findings
- Draft an email to Susan and Paula summarizing your findings, including the Implied Equity Value and Implied Share Price.

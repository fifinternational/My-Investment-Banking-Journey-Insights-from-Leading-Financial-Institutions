#### Email Structure
Subject: Europe Focus Fund (EFF) â€“ Requested Suggestions

Dear Louise,

As we discussed, I have reviewed the information regarding the Europe Focus Fund (EFF) and would like to share several recommendations based on the data.

Increase the Number of Stocks Held: By increasing the number of stocks in the portfolio, we can reduce volatility and bring the beta closer to 1. The analysis of the time series graphs indicates that both volatility and beta are currently above historical trends. This adjustment would help lower the absolute risk of the portfolio in relation to the index.

Reduce Uninvested Cash: The current uninvested cash level stands at 6.7%, which is higher than historical averages and may be negatively affecting the fund's short-term performance.

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Analyst

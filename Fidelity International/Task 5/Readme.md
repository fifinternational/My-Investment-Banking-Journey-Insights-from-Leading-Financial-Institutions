# Task 5: Create an Optimized Multi-Asset Portfolio

## Overview
In this task, you will learn how to maximize risk-adjusted returns over a benchmark through targeted asset allocation. You will use the Sharpe Ratio and Excel’s Solver function to calculate the optimal portfolio weightings for a selection of eight funds. This exercise will enhance your understanding of portfolio management and the quantitative methods used to optimize investment strategies.

## Objectives
- Understand the principles of portfolio optimization and the role of the Sharpe Ratio in evaluating risk-adjusted returns.
- Utilize Excel’s Solver function to determine the optimal weightings for each fund in a multi-asset portfolio.
- Analyze historical performance data to inform your investment decisions.

## Key Learning Points
- **Fixed Income and Equity Funds:** Understanding the characteristics and performance metrics of different types of funds, including fixed income and equity funds.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Familiarity with the process of adjusting asset allocations to achieve desired risk and return profiles.
- **Sharpe Ratio:** The importance of the Sharpe Ratio as a measure of risk-adjusted return, which helps investors assess the performance of an investment relative to its risk.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Understand the Context
- Investment managers often create portfolios that consist of multiple funds to achieve specific risk and return objectives. The performance of these portfolios is influenced by the allocation of assets among the selected funds.
- The Sharpe Ratio is used to evaluate the performance of the portfolio by comparing the excess return of the portfolio to its standard deviation (risk).

### 2. Review Supporting Materials
- You will be provided with an Excel template that contains historical performance data for each of the eight funds. This data will be essential for your analysis.
- Review the reading guide provided to familiarize yourself with the technical aspects of the task.

### 3. Complete the Excel Template
- Open the Excel template and follow the instructions provided within the file. You will need to:
  - Input the historical performance data for each fund.
  - Use the Solver function to calculate the optimal portfolio weightings for the funds, ensuring that the total weightings sum to 100%.
  - Compare the risk-adjusted returns of your optimized portfolio with that of the S&P 500 benchmark using the Sharpe Ratio.

### 4. Enable Excel’s Solver Add-In
- Before commencing the task, ensure that the Solver Add-In is enabled in Microsoft Excel. Instructions for enabling the add-in can typically be found in Excel's help section or online resources.

### 5. Analyze Your Results
- After calculating the optimal weightings, analyze the results to understand how the selected asset allocation impacts the overall risk and return of the portfolio.

### 6. Review and Submit
- Double-check your Excel file for accuracy and completeness.
- Submit the completed Excel document as instructed.

## Conclusion
By completing this task, you will gain valuable experience in portfolio optimization and the quantitative methods used in investment management. This knowledge will be beneficial in your future roles in finance and asset management. Good luck!

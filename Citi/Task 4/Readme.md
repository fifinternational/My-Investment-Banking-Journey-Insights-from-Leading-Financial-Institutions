   The company has outlined its plans for growth by venturing into new product categories such as fitness and wellness, personal electronic transportation, and outdoor living. The push into fitness and wellness is primarily driven by an appealing total addressable market (TAM) valued at over $25 billion annually, alongside the macro backdrop of an aging U.S. population and ongoing advancements in digital health devices.

   Additionally, the company has defined the category of "personal electronic transportation," which encompasses e-bikes, scooters, mopeds, dirt bikes, skateboards, and go-karts. This will enable the company to capture a share of a $3 billion market niche while also introducing unique and exciting new merchandise in-store to boost foot traffic in its more than 900 domestic locations.

   Finally, outdoor living represents a $30 billion market opportunity. The companyâ€™s commitment to this sector is underscored by its 2021 acquisition of Yardbird, a leading premium outdoor furniture brand. In summary, these three growth areas allow the company to offer its customers more options while enhancing and diversifying its existing portfolio, fulfilling its mission of enriching lives through technology.

4. **Review and Submit:**

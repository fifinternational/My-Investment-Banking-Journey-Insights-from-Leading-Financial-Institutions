# Task 6: Improve a Trade Process

## Overview
In this task, you will redesign the operating process for handling currency trade instructions for a longtime HSBC client in Italy. The client has been sending faxed instructions to HSBC's Hong Kong Custody office for over 20 years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to remote work, HSBC can no longer process these faxed instructions. You will create a new process based on electronic instructions and communicate the benefits of this change to the client.

## Objectives
- Understand the role of custodian banks and the importance of efficient trade processes.
- Redesign the operating process to facilitate digital instructions for currency trades.
- Communicate effectively with the client about the transition from fax to digital instructions.

## Key Learning Points
- **Custodian Banks:** Understanding the role of custodian banks in holding and managing client assets, as well as facilitating trades and settlements.
- **Process Improvement:** Identifying inefficiencies in existing processes and proposing solutions that enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs.
- **Client Communication:** Effectively communicating changes to clients and the benefits of adopting new technologies.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Understand the Context
- The client has been using faxed instructions to buy and sell currencies (HKD, EUR, and USD) for over two decades.
- Due to the pandemic, HSBC can no longer receive and process faxed instructions, necessitating a shift to a digital process.

### 2. Redesign the Operating Process
- Develop a new process that allows the client to send electronic instructions for currency trades. Consider the following:
  - How the client will submit instructions digitally (e.g., through a secure online platform).
  - The steps involved in processing these digital instructions.
  - The roles of operational staff in handling digital instructions versus faxed ones.
- Create a PowerPoint slide that outlines the new process. Ensure that the slide is clear, concise, and visually appealing.

### 3. Prepare the Voice Message
- Record a voice message to the client explaining why they should stop sending fax instructions and switch to the digital banking platform. Your message should include:
  - The benefits of using the digital platform (e.g., efficiency, security, cost savings).
  - Assurance that the transition will improve the overall trading experience.
- Keep the voice message between 30 and 60 seconds long.

### 4. Review and Submit
- Double-check your PowerPoint slide for clarity, accuracy, and professionalism.
- Submit the completed PowerPoint slide as instructed.
- Record and submit your voice message in the next step.

## Conclusion
By completing this task, you will gain valuable experience in process improvement and client communication within the context of a custodian bank. This knowledge will be beneficial in your future roles in finance and operations. Good luck!
